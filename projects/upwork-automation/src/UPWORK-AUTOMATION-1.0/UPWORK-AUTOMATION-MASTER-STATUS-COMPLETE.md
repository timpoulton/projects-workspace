### 📄 Multi-Model AI Proposal Generation (Updated)

- **Endpoint:**  
  The multi-model AI proposal generation endpoint is now:  
  `http://192.168.1.107:5001/proposal`  
  (Previously, it was “/proposal/generate”.)

- **Test Script:**  
  A test script (`scripts/upwork-automation/test-multimodel.py`) is available.  
  It reads a real job (for example, the first job) from `proposal-queue.json` and calls the multi-model AI (via a POST to the “/proposal” endpoint) to generate a proposal.  
  You can run it via:  
  ```bash  
  python3 scripts/upwork-automation/test-multimodel.py  
  ```  
  (This script adheres to homelab and Cursor standardization rules.)

- **Job Data Schema (from Chrome Extension)**  
  (See the “Job Data Schema” section above for details on the payload sent by the Chrome extension.)

- **Proposal Output:**  
  The generated proposal (JSON) includes fields such as “job_title”, “message”, “score”, “status”, “proposal_url”, “filename”, “ai_model_used”, “server_version”, etc.

- **Documentation:**  
  This update is reflected in the master documentation (UPWORK-AUTOMATION-MASTER-STATUS-COMPLETE.md) and in the inline comments of test-multimodel.py.
