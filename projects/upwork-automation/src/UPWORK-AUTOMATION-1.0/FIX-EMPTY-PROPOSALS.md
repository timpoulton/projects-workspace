# Fix for Empty Proposal Templates

## Problem
When clicking "Generate Proposal", the system shows the template with placeholder text ({{JOB_TITLE}}, {{CLIENT_NAME}}, etc.) instead of actual data.

## Root Cause
The Multi-Model AI server (`upwork-proposal-server-multimodel.py`) is:
1. Returning empty `job_title` fields in its responses
2. Rejecting jobs with score 0
3. Not preserving the original job data when generating proposals

## Quick Fix Applied
We've updated `simple-upwork-generator.py` to:
1. Always preserve original job data from the queue
2. Fall back to simple proposal generation if the multi-model AI fails
3. Add better error handling and logging

## Solutions

### Option 1: Use Simple Proposal Generation (Recommended for Now)
The system now automatically falls back to simple proposal generation when the multi-model AI fails. This ensures you always get a proposal with the correct job data.

### Option 2: Fix the Multi-Model AI Server
The multi-model AI server needs to be updated to:
1. Preserve the original job_title in responses
2. Not reject all jobs automatically
3. Return proper proposal data even for lower-scoring jobs

### Option 3: Bypass AI Filtering
You can modify the multi-model AI server to always generate proposals regardless of score:
```python
# In upwork-proposal-server-multimodel.py, find the rejection logic and comment it out
# Or set a minimum score threshold of 0 instead of rejecting
```

## Current Status
- ✅ Simple proposal generation is working
- ✅ Job data is preserved from the queue
- ✅ Template formatting is working
- ❌ Multi-model AI is rejecting all jobs
- ❌ Multi-model AI returns empty job_title

## Testing
To test if proposals are working:
```bash
# Test with a real job from the queue
curl -X POST http://localhost:5056/generate-from-queue -d "job_id=job_1748925512330"
```

## Next Steps
1. The system should now generate proposals with proper data (using fallback)
2. To get AI-enhanced proposals, the multi-model AI server needs to be fixed
3. Consider adjusting the AI's filtering criteria to be less restrictive
