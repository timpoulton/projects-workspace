## üß≠ Project Purpose & Approach

**Purpose:**  
This project is a personal automation tool for efficiently responding to Upwork job postings. It is designed to:
- Save time by automatically filtering out irrelevant jobs based on your specific skills and professional focus.
- Ensure you only see and respond to jobs that are a perfect fit for your expertise.
- Generate high-quality, personalized proposals using advanced AI, so you can win more of the right jobs with less manual effort.

**Approach:**  
- We are developing and perfecting each core function (starting with the scoring/filtering system) in isolation, with thorough testing and documentation, before integrating them into the full workflow.
- The scoring system is the "gatekeeper" that ensures only the best jobs move forward to the proposal generation and dashboard stages.

## üì• Webhook Data Format (Job Intake)

**Endpoint:**  
`POST http://192.168.1.107:5001/webhook/rss-jobs`

**Expected Payload:**  
A JSON array of job objects, each with the following fields:

```json
[
  {
    "title": "Job Title",
    "description": "Job description text...",
    "budget": "Budget string or number",
    "guid": "Unique job ID (optional)",
    "link": "Original Upwork job URL"
    // (optionally: client info, posted time, skills, etc.)
  }
]
```

**Field Usage:**
- `title` and `description`: Used for scoring, filtering, and proposal generation.
- `budget`: Used for scoring and proposal content.
- `guid`: Used as a unique identifier (if present).
- `link`: Used for reference and dashboard display.
- Optional fields (client info, posted time, skills) are used for richer analysis if present.

### üìÑ Job Data Schema (from Chrome Extension)

When the Chrome extension scrapes a job, it sends data to the webhook in the following format:

```json
[
  {
    "title": "Job Title",
    "url": "https://www.upwork.com/jobs/example",
    "jobType": "Hourly",
    "skillLevel": "Expert",
    "budget": "N/A",
    "hourlyRange": "$30-50",
    "estimatedTime": "Less than 30 hrs/week",
    "description": "Job description text...",
    "skills": ["JavaScript", "React", "Node.js", "API Development"],
    "paymentVerified": true,
    "clientRating": "4.95",
    "clientSpent": "$10K+ spent",
    "clientCountry": "United States",
    "questions": [
      "What similar projects have you worked on?",
      "What is your experience with React?"
    ],
    "clientLocation": "San Francisco, CA",
    "scrapedAt": 1749499907617,
    "scrapedAtHuman": "10/06/2025, 06:11:47",
    "sourceUrl": "https://www.upwork.com/nx/search/jobs/?sort=recency",
    "source": {
      "name": "New Configuration",
      "searchUrl": "...",
      "webhookUrl": "..."
    }
  }
]
```

**Field Descriptions:**
- `title`: The job title as posted on Upwork.
- `url`: Direct link to the job posting.
- `jobType`: Type of job (e.g., Hourly, Fixed).
- `skillLevel`: Required expertise level.
- `budget`: Budget for the job (may be N/A for hourly).
- `hourlyRange`: Hourly pay range (if applicable).
- `estimatedTime`: Estimated weekly hours or project duration.
- `description`: Full job description.
- `skills`: Array of required or preferred skills.
- `paymentVerified`: Whether the client's payment method is verified.
- `clientRating`: Client's Upwork rating.
- `clientSpent`: Total amount spent by the client on Upwork.
- `clientCountry`: Client's country.
- `questions`: Screening questions from the client.
- `clientLocation`: Client's city/state (if available).
- `scrapedAt`: Timestamp of when the job was scraped.
- `scrapedAtHuman`: Human-readable scrape time.
- `sourceUrl`: The search URL used to find the job.
- `source`: Metadata about the scraping configuration.

---

## üß† Scoring System Overview

- Each job is analyzed and scored using a configurable set of rules (see `scoring-config.json`).
- Jobs are categorized as "Must Apply," "Should Apply," "Consider," or "Skip" based on their score and relevance.
- Only jobs that pass the scoring threshold are saved to the queue and move on to proposal generation.

---

## üì¶ Job Storage & Data Flow

**Storage Location:**
- Jobs that pass the scoring filter are stored in `/root/homelab-docs/scripts/upwork-automation/proposal-queue.json`.
- This file contains a JSON array of job objects, each with fields such as:
  - `job_id`, `job_title`, `client_name`, `budget`, `description`, `analysis` (score, keywords, etc.), `message` (proposal), `status`, and more.

**Purpose:**
- The queue acts as the "inbox" for jobs ready for review, proposal generation, or dashboard display.

**API Endpoints:**
- The dashboard and other components fetch jobs via HTTP GET requests to:
  - `/api/proposals` (returns all jobs in the queue)
  - `/data/proposals.json` (dashboard format)

**Status Tracking:**
- Each job has a `status` field (e.g., "pending", "approved", "rejected") to track its progress.
- When a job is approved or rejected in the dashboard, its status is updated or it is removed from the queue.

**Best Practices:**
- Use atomic writes when updating the queue file to avoid corruption.
- Limit the queue to the most recent N jobs (e.g., 100) for performance.
- Ensure every job has a unique `job_id` for tracking and updates.
- Maintain consistent API/data formats across all components.
