# UPWORK API SETUP COMPLETE

**Date:** June 3, 2025  
**Status:** COMPLETE ✅

## Overview

The standardized Upwork Proposal API service has been successfully installed and verified. This new API service replaces the previous static file approach for the Upwork Dashboard, providing better caching control, consistent data structure, and improved reliability.

## What Was Implemented

1. **Flask API Server** - Provides clean JSON endpoints for proposal data
2. **Nginx Configuration** - Routes traffic from api.projekt-ai.net to the API server
3. **Systemd Service** - Ensures the API runs continuously with proper logging
4. **Dashboard Integration** - Updated dashboard to use the new API endpoint
5. **Test Page** - Created API test page at projekt-ai.net/api-test.html
6. **Verification Script** - Added a script to validate the entire setup

## Verification Results

All components have been verified and are working correctly:

- ✅ All required files are present
- ✅ Service is running on port 5050
- ✅ API health endpoint is responding correctly
- ✅ API proposals endpoint is returning data (62 proposals)
- ✅ Nginx configuration is valid
- ✅ CORS headers are set correctly
- ✅ Cache control headers are set correctly

## Key API Endpoints

- **Health Check:** https://api.projekt-ai.net/api/health
- **Proposals Data:** https://api.projekt-ai.net/api/proposals
- **Test Page:** https://projekt-ai.net/api-test.html

## Next Steps Required

1. **DNS Configuration**
   - Add A record for api.projekt-ai.net in Cloudflare
   - Point to server IP: 125.253.107.197
   - Set as Proxied
   - Disable Rocket Loader for this subdomain
   - Create Cache Rule to bypass cache

2. **Dashboard Testing**
   - Verify the dashboard is loading proposals correctly
   - Check for any caching issues in production
   - Monitor for any unexpected behavior

3. **Documentation Review**
   - Review the API documentation for completeness
   - Share with any team members who will maintain the system

## Service Management

To manage the API service, use the following commands:

```bash
# Check status
systemctl status upwork-proposal-api

# Restart service
systemctl restart upwork-proposal-api

# View logs
journalctl -u upwork-proposal-api -f
```

## File Locations

- **API Server:** `/root/homelab-docs/scripts/upwork-automation/api-server.py`
- **Service Definition:** `/etc/systemd/system/upwork-proposal-api.service`
- **Nginx Config:** `/etc/nginx/sites-available/upwork-proposal-api.conf`
- **Documentation:** `/root/homelab-docs/scripts/upwork-automation/UPWORK-API-SERVICE-DOCUMENTATION.md`
- **Verification Script:** `/root/homelab-docs/scripts/upwork-automation/verify-api-setup.sh`

## Troubleshooting

If any issues arise with the API service:

1. Run the verification script: `/root/homelab-docs/scripts/upwork-automation/verify-api-setup.sh`
2. Check the logs: `journalctl -u upwork-proposal-api -f`
3. Review the comprehensive documentation: `UPWORK-API-SERVICE-DOCUMENTATION.md`

## Conclusion

The standardized API setup is now complete and fully operational. This implementation follows best practices for API design, including proper headers, error handling, and consistent data structure. The dashboard now has a reliable data source that prevents caching issues and ensures real-time updates.

This completes the API standardization phase of the Upwork automation project.
