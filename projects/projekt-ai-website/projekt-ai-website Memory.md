**Issue:** "Logo not displaying or wrong size"
**Solution:**
1. Check path: `assets/img/logos/light-logo.png`
2. Verify `.logo-image` class applied
3. Run Figma sync if needed: `./scripts/run-figma-sync.sh`

### **Performance Baselines**
- **First Load:** < 2 seconds on fast connection
- **Animation Smoothness:** 60fps with hardware acceleration
- **Lighthouse Score:** 90+ performance, 100 accessibility
