We’re building a CV & Cover Letter Generator feature inside our training/education focused web app. The goal is to let students quickly generate CV & cover letter using AI, customize them with simple edits, and export them as pdf or word. We're looking for someone to build this end to end, starting with a clean form and finishing with downloadable documents.

Here’s what you’ll be working on:

Create a student facing input form to collect basic data like name, degree, skills, and experience. Track their progress through the form.

Integrate with OpenAI or Claude APIs (or other, to be decided in time) to generate a CV and cover letter based on that input.

Display the generated documents on screen, letting the user preview and make basic edits.

Add support to download the documents as PDF or Word files.

Implement temporary save functionality using browser storage so users don’t lose their work.

Build template switching: users should be able to toggle between two CV and two cover letter templates and see how their content looks in each.

Do functional testing to make sure input, AI generation, editing, switching, downloading, and saving all work smoothly.

You’ll be working inside a React codebase that already has structure in place. Clean, modular implementation and speed of delivery matter.
